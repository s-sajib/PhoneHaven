## What is PhoneHaven?

PhoneHaven is a community driven project for gathering information of lost handheld devices such as phones, tablets and iPads. It uses IMEI number of a device to keep track of lost devices and in case another user of the site stumbles upon it, the device can be reported as found too!

It'll also serve as a checklist for buying a second hand phone, to ensure somewhat safety that the phone isn't stolen. ðŸ¥·
